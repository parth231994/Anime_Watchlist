This project aims to solve the problem of diffrent series being split across multiple streaming-sites by providing a place where all the bookmarks can be stored, with some Quality of Life features such as single-click access to stream a particular episode and an Episode counter to keep track of your progress.
This Project is aimed mainly towards Anime-fans, but can be used for any online media.

Featurelist:
- ~~**user can add a series/episode**~~
  - ~~**link to the current episode**~~
  - ~~**a pattern for the current season** (or series) (used to link to next episode correctly)~~
  - ~~a preview-image (link) (if null display a default img) (stretched to fit size)~~
  - **an intervall / date for currently airing seriesâ€˜ countdown**
- user can see meta-information for supported content-type
  > (e.g. see information for anime provided by MyAnimeList.net)
- ~~**user can go to current episode in one click**~~
- ~~user can edit the saved information~~
- user can delete Series/Season/Episode
- ~~**user can increment current episode Nr.** (either by 1 (default) or multiple)~~
- ~~user can mark series/season/episode as finished/unfinished (toggle)~~
- option to auto-remove finished series/episodes

Main Features are formatted bold and will take priority.

We plan to implement this Project by using Node.js together with Mongoose (and MongoDB) for the backend and persistent data storage, while the Frontend will be made with React.
Frontend and Backend will communicate via a REST-API using json.
Login will be handled by using json Web Tokens which are sent in the header.

The Development is going to be split into frontend and backend with a pre-defined Interface between those two.
This README will be updated throughout the Development.

I plan on continuing development for personal use later.
This project also contains a [Wiki](https://gitlab.hochschule-stralsund.de/tobias.hellweg/anime-watchlist/-/wikis/home), with some useful Information about the Project.# Anime_Watchlist
